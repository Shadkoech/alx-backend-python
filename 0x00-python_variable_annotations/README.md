# Python - Variable Annotations

## Description
This project delves into the realm of Advanced Python concepts, specifically focusing on type annotations in Python 3. Type annotations provide a powerful way to enhance code clarity and maintainability by specifying function signatures and variable types. This project is essentially a deep dive into the intricacies of type annotations and learning how to apply them effectively in your code. Additionally, it also explores the invaluable tool of mypy for validating annotated code, ensuring its correctness and robustness.

## Resources
These two documents are handy in the exploring the concept

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)


## Setup

Start by installing mypy by running `pip install mypy`
Then to validate the annotated code run `mypy your_code.py`
